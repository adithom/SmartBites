SmartBites aims to decentralize the ecosystem surrounding food delivery. The app has separate sections for people wanting to order in and for people who want to deliver food. It works by issuing a smart contract in the ether blockchain that has two payout parties involved: the restaurant and the driver. Once the smart contract is deployed, people who are in the delivery section of the app sees nearby contract offer and can sign the ones they find most attractive.

A delivery driver can pick the food up, and bring the food the front door and scans a QR Code on the package at the front door camera. The video footage from that moment will be processed on the blockchain using iExec and YOLOv7 which will be on the look out for porch piracy. The video processing will only end when the user confirms that they picked up the package. The gas fees for this processing will be charged from the user's wallet.
